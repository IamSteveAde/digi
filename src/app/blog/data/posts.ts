      Try applying for a job today without a phone. Try running a business
      without mobile data. Try learning a new skill when your village has no
      internet connection.
    </p>

    <p class="lede-strong">
      That’s digital poverty. And it’s more common than you think.
    </p>
  </div>

  <!-- CONTEXT -->
  <div class="article-body">
    <p>
      Digital poverty happens when people don’t have the tools, knowledge,
      or access to take part in an increasingly online world. It means you
      don’t have a working device, you can’t afford data, or no one ever
      showed you how to use these tools in the first place.
    </p>

    <p>
      This isn’t just a personal problem. It’s a social one.
    </p>

    <p>
      For some, digital poverty means being unable to join online classes
      because the household owns just one phone. For others, it means
      walking long distances to borrow a device just to fill out a
      government form or apply for a grant.
    </p>

    <p>
      Sometimes, it’s as simple and devastating as not knowing that an
      opportunity even existed, because it was shared online.
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      This is the silent exclusion that’s growing wider every year.
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      And it’s not just a rural problem. Even in cities, people are affected
      by poor network coverage, unaffordable data, or outdated devices.
      Young people with potential are locked out of opportunities.
      Women who could grow small businesses are limited by lack of access.
      Elderly people can’t get basic services or connect with their families.
    </p>
  </div>

  <!-- REALITY CHECK -->
  <div class="article-focus">
    <p>
      Many people believe digital poverty can be fixed by handing out phones
      or laptops. That’s a start — but it’s not enough.
    </p>

    <p>
      You can give someone a smartphone. But what if they don’t know how to
      send an email, use Google Maps, or fill out a digital form?
      You can set up free Wi-Fi. But what if people are afraid to use it
      because they’ve been scammed before?
    </p>

    <p>
      Real digital inclusion means <strong>access plus training plus trust</strong>.
      Anything less is just a temporary fix.
    </p>
  </div>

  <!-- WHAT’S AT STAKE -->
  <div class="article-body">
    <p>
      Let’s be honest: everything is going online. Government services,
      health records, business tools, education platforms, job boards,
      bank accounts, voter registration, and even social interaction.
    </p>

    <p>
      If you’re offline, you’re not just missing out — you’re being left
      behind. You’re forced to rely on others. You’re less able to protect
      yourself, earn a living, or plan for the future.

    <p class="lede">
      Gender inequality isn’t just about how many women are in school or how many
      men are in power.
    </p>

    <p class="lede-strong">
      It’s about control — over time, income, choices, and opportunity.
    </p>
  </div>

  <!-- CONTEXT -->
  <div class="article-body">
    <p>
      In many parts of the world, including Nigeria, that control is still limited.
      The gender gap shows up everywhere — in pay, land ownership, leadership,
      and representation in public office.
    </p>

    <p>
      Women are more likely to carry the burden of unpaid care work: cooking,
      cleaning, and looking after children, often without support or recognition.
    </p>

    <p>
      According to the <strong>2024 Global Gender Gap Report</strong>, full equality
      is still more than a century away. That means girls born today may grow up
      facing the same barriers their mothers and grandmothers did.
    </p>
  </div>

  <!-- DATA POINT -->
  <div class="article-focus">
    <blockquote>
      In Nigeria, women make up nearly half the population,
      yet hold less than 20% of senior roles across government and business.
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      That’s not just unfair — it’s a waste of talent. When women are excluded,
      families, businesses, and entire economies miss out.
    </p>

    <p>
      Countries with higher gender equality consistently show stronger economies,
      healthier children, and more stable communities.
    </p>
  </div>

  <!-- DIGITAL GAP -->
  <div class="article-body">
    <p>
      One of the fastest-growing inequalities today is the <strong>digital gender gap</strong>.
      As jobs, services, and opportunities move online, women without access to
      phones, data, or basic digital skills are left behind.
    </p>

    <p>
      In Nigeria, women are far less likely than men to own smartphones or use the
      internet regularly. This limits access to jobs, business tools, financial
      services, and even critical health and safety information.
    </p>
  </div>

  <!-- SOLUTIONS -->
  <div class="article-focus">
    <h3>How Do We Bridge the Gap?</h3>

    <p>
      Closing the gender gap starts with intentional investment in three areas:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Education and skills training</strong> — not just schooling, but
        relevant skills such as digital literacy, finance, leadership, and negotiation.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Fair policies and enforcement</strong> — laws must work in practice,
        not just exist on paper.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Access to tools and capital</strong> — smartphones, data,
        business funding, and safe mobility.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <!-- CLOSING -->
  <div class="article-action">
    <p class="closing">
      Bridging the gender gap won’t happen overnight — but it also won’t happen by
      accident.
    </p>

    <p>
      It requires action from governments, communities, employers, and individuals
      to remove the barriers that keep women stuck.
    </p>

    <p class="final">
      The goal is not to help women “catch up.”
      It’s to build a world where gender is no longer a barrier to success.

  <div class="article-focus">
    <h3>Why It Matters</h3>

    <p>
      In a world where information is power, millions of Nigerians — particularly
      those in rural and low-income communities — still lack reliable internet,
      functional devices, and the skills needed to use them effectively.
    </p>

      healthcare access, and participation in the wider digital economy.

      In today’s fast-moving digital economy, skills alone are no longer enough.
    </p>

    <p class="lede-strong">
      Success is shaped by mindset — how we learn, adapt, and respond to change.
    </p>
  </div>

  <!-- CONTEXT -->
  <div class="article-body">
    <p>
      On <strong>November 14, 2025</strong>, the <strong>Digital Inclusion Initiative (DII)</strong>
      hosted a powerful virtual learning session titled
      <strong>“Embracing a Growth Mindset in Your Digital Journey”</strong>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Held via <strong>Zoom</strong>, the session was led by technology leader
      <strong>Wumi Akinseye</strong> and brought together learners, professionals,
      and aspiring digital workers for a conversation that went beyond tools
      and into the psychology of digital success.
    </p>

    <p>
      Rather than focusing solely on technical skills, the discussion explored
      how mindset influences learning, confidence, and long-term career growth
      in the digital economy.
    </p>
  </div>

  <!-- WHY IT MATTERS -->
  <div class="article-focus">
    <h3>Why This Conversation Matters</h3>

    <p>
      Across Nigeria and Africa, millions of people are gaining access to digital
      tools — yet many still struggle with confidence, fear of failure, and
      imposter syndrome.
    </p>

    <p>
      At DII, digital inclusion goes beyond devices and connectivity. It also
      means helping people believe that they belong in the digital economy.
    </p>

    <p>
      This session aligned directly with DII’s mission to bridge the digital
      divide by empowering individuals not just with technology, but with the
      mindset needed to thrive.
    </p>
  </div>

  <!-- KEY LESSONS -->
  <div class="article-focus">
    <h3>Key Lessons from Wumi Akinseye</h3>

    <p>
      Drawing on over <strong>20 years of experience</strong> driving digital
      transformation across global industries, Wumi shared practical insights
      into how mindset shapes professional growth.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Fear of failure is often the biggest barrier to learning</strong> —
        many people avoid digital tools not because they lack ability, but
        because they fear getting it wrong.
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>Growth happens through experimentation</strong> — trying, failing,
        and trying again is how digital professionals build real expertise.
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>Resilience is a career skill</strong> — in a constantly changing
        digital landscape, adaptability is more valuable than any single tool
        or platform.
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>Confidence grows through small wins</strong> — consistent, simple
        actions build momentum and belief over time.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <!-- PRACTICAL TAKEAWAYS -->
  <div class="article-focus">
    <h3>Practical Takeaways for Learners</h3>

    <p>
      Through guided discussion and Q&amp;A, participants explored how to apply
      a growth mindset in their daily learning and work.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        Reframing mistakes as feedback rather than failure
      </li>

      <li>
        Staying curious instead of afraid when facing new technology
      </li>

      <li>
        Developing the habit of continuous learning
      </li>

      <li>
        Building emotional resilience in fast-changing work environments
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Wumi also encouraged participants to take three simple steps this month:
      try one new digital skill, reflect on what they learned, and commit to one
      improvement.
    </p>

  <div class="article-intro">
    <p class="lede">
      Financial inclusion is not just about access to technology — it is about
      confidence in using it.
    </p>

    <p class="lede-strong">
      Digital confidence is the missing link between connectivity and real
      economic empowerment.
    </p>
  </div>

  <!-- CONTEXT -->
  <div class="article-body">
    <p>
      On <strong>Friday, November 21, 2025</strong>, the <strong>Digital Inclusion Initiative (DII)</strong>
      hosted a powerful virtual learning session titled
      <strong>“Unlocking Financial Inclusion”</strong> with fintech expert
      <strong>Francis Nwoboshi</strong> — a leading voice in digital payments and
      financial inclusion across Africa and the UK.
    </p>

    <p>
      The session brought together learners, professionals, and community
      members united by one goal: understanding how digital skills can unlock
      real financial power in everyday life.
    </p>

    <p>
      Despite having over <strong>100 million internet users</strong>, millions
      of Nigerian adults remain excluded from formal financial services —
      revealing a critical gap between access and participation.
    </p>
  </div>

  <!-- CORE INSIGHT -->
  <div class="article-focus">
    <h3>The Digital Confidence Gap</h3>

    <p>
      As Francis explained, Nigeria faces a dangerous paradox:
    </p>

    <p>
      <em>
        “Technology access alone does not guarantee financial inclusion.
        The missing link is digital confidence.”
      </em>
    </p>

    <p>
      Many Nigerians own smartphones but still hesitate to:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Use mobile banking applications</li>
      <li>Make digital payments</li>
      <li>Apply for credit or savings products</li>
      <li>Trust online financial tools</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Fear, low digital literacy, and lack of confidence keep people locked out
      of the digital economy — even when the tools are already in their hands.
    </p>
  </div>

  <!-- KEY LEARNINGS -->
  <div class="article-focus">
    <h3>Key Insights from the Session</h3>

    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong>Digital Skills Lead to Financial Power</strong><br />
        The ability to use mobile apps, payment platforms, and online services
        opens doors to banking, credit, business tools, and savings or
        investment products. Without these skills, many people remain
        economically invisible.
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>Digital Confidence Is the True Gateway</strong><br />
        The biggest barriers to financial inclusion are often psychological —
        fear of making mistakes, fear of fraud, fear of losing money, and fear
        of not understanding how systems work.
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>Simple Interventions Can Change Lives</strong><br />
        Confidence grows through guided practice, human support, and simple,
        intuitive digital experiences.
      </li>
    </ol>
  </div>

  <!-- SOLUTIONS -->
  <div class="article-focus">
    <h3>What Actually Works</h3>

    <p>
      The session explored practical solutions that have proven effective in
      helping first-time users move from fear to mastery:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Agent-assisted digital onboarding</li>
      <li>In-app tutorials with real-world practice</li>
      <li>Plain-language design and localized digital tools</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <!-- CASE STUDY -->
  <div class="article-focus">
    <h3>Real-World Proof: The OPay Case Study</h3>

    <p>
      Francis shared how <strong>OPay</strong> successfully brought millions of
      Nigerians into digital payments by focusing on:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Easy and intuitive onboarding</li>
      <li>Human support systems</li>
      <li>A simple and trusted user experience</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      The lesson was clear: confidence — not just connectivity — drives true
      financial inclusion.
    </p>
  </div>

  <!-- DII MISSION -->
  <div class="article-focus">
    <h3>How This Supports DII’s Mission</h3>

    <p>
      At DII, digital inclusion must lead to real economic empowerment —
      not just access.
    </p>

    <p>
      That is why our work is built on three core pillars:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>📱 Device Bank</strong> — access to refurbished digital devices</li>
      <li><strong>🌐 Data Bank</strong> — affordable and reliable connectivity</li>
      <li><strong>🎓 DII Academy</strong> — practical digital skills training</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      This session directly supports our goal of helping people move from owning
      devices, to using them confidently, to earning and participating in the
      digital economy.
    </p>
  </div>

  <!-- WHAT'S NEXT -->
  <div class="article-focus">
    <h3>What’s Next?</h3>

    <p>
      Francis also introduced a new opportunity for <strong>DII Academy</strong>
      members — a digital entrepreneurship pathway powered by
      <strong>Vendify</strong>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Through this pathway, learners can:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Sell airtime, data, electricity, and more</li>
      <li>Earn commissions directly from their smartphones</li>
      <li>Build micro-income streams within their communities</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      This is what true digital inclusion looks like — not just being connected,
      but being able to earn.
    </p>
  </div>

  <!-- CLOSING -->
  <div class="article-action">
    <p class="closing">
      Financial inclusion is not just about banking. It is about dignity,
      opportunity, and control over one’s future.
    </p>

    <p>
      Every digital skill learned, every confident tap on a screen, and every
      successful transaction brings someone closer to economic independence.
    </p>

    <p>
      At DII, we are proud to walk this journey with our community — one
      confident digital step at a time.

      The future of work is no longer coming — it is already here.

  <!-- CONTEXT -->
  <div class="article-body">
    <p>
      As industries across the world continue to digitise, opportunities for
      women to participate, lead, and thrive in the digital economy have never
      been greater. Yet for many women across Africa, access to skills,
      confidence, and clear digital pathways remains a challenge.
    </p>

    <p>
      On <strong>December 19, 2025</strong>, the <strong>Digital Inclusion Initiative (DII)</strong>
      hosted a powerful virtual webinar titled
      <strong>“The Future of Work Is Digital – Are Women Ready?”</strong>,
      featuring <strong>Maureen Ikeji</strong>, a respected business leader,
      strategist, and advocate for women’s leadership and growth.
    </p>

    <p>
      The session brought together women from diverse backgrounds who were eager
      to understand how technology is reshaping careers — and how they can
      position themselves for success in a rapidly evolving digital world.
    </p>
  </div>

  <!-- SPEAKER -->
  <div class="article-focus">
    <h3>Meet the Speaker</h3>

    <p>
      <strong>Maureen Ikeji</strong> is a business thought leader passionate about
      leadership growth and results, with over <strong>20 years of experience</strong>
      across IT consulting, manufacturing, supply chain, project management, and
      marketing.
    </p>

    <p>
      Prior to her current role, she served as <strong>Head of Strategy, Planning

      multidisciplinary team responsible for shaping the business agenda across
      several West African markets.

  <!-- KEY THEMES -->
  <div class="article-focus">
    <h3>Rethinking Readiness for the Future of Work</h3>

    <p>
      During the session, Maureen challenged participants to rethink what it
      truly means to be “ready” for the future of work.
    </p>

    <p>
      She explained that digital readiness is not only about acquiring technical
      skills, but also about cultivating the right mindset, confidence, and
      adaptability.
    </p>

    <p>
      As automation, remote work, and digital platforms continue to transform
      how people earn a living, women who intentionally build digital capability

    <p>
      The <strong>Digital Inclusion Initiative (DII)</strong>, in partnership
      with <strong>American Corner Ikeja</strong>, delivered one of its most
      ambitious and impactful youth programmes yet with the
      <strong>BeatCode Hackathon 2026</strong>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Held over two high-energy days on <strong>Thursday 8th</strong> and
      <strong>Friday 9th January</strong> at <strong>American Corner Ikeja, Lagos</strong>,
      the programme was designed for young people aged <strong>16 to 26</strong>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Rather than beginning with intimidating lines of code, participants were
      introduced to programming through music — using
      <strong>EarSketch</strong>, a powerful music-coding platform that allows
      users to create beats, melodies, and full compositions through code.
    </p>
  </div>

  <!-- EXPERIENCE -->
  <div class="article-focus">
    <h3>Learning to Code Through Creativity</h3>

    <p>
      For many participants, BeatCode Hackathon marked their first experience
      with both programming and digital music creation.
    </p>

    <p>
      Within just two days, young people who had never written code before were
      building real, functioning digital products — writing scripts that
      generated drum patterns, loops, melodies, and complete musical tracks.
    </p>

    <p>
      The hackathon reimagined how young Nigerians experience technology by
      proving that creativity can be a powerful gateway into digital skills.

    <p>
      Over the course of the programme, <strong>30 participants</strong> were

      individual required to code their own beat independently.
    </p>

    <p>
      After completing their tracks, groups listened to all submissions and
      voted to select one beat to represent them. These selected entries were
      then presented to a panel of expert judges, turning the experience into a
      real-world innovation challenge.
    </p>

    <p>
      The format blended technical learning, creativity, teamwork, and public

      already started coding an original beat.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Day Two</strong> centred on refinement, collaboration, and

    <h3>Celebrating Excellence</h3>

    <p>
      As final presentations concluded and judges deliberated, what began as
      curiosity had evolved into polished, coded musical creations.
    </p>

    <p>
      At the awards ceremony, two standout winners emerged:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>The Jazz Group</strong> — Best Group Beat</li>
      <li><strong>Kennior</strong> — Best Individual Beat</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Both winners demonstrated how quickly young people can move from learning
      to excellence when given the right tools and support.

    <h3>Beyond the Competition</h3>

    <p>
      Beyond prizes, every participant left with something far more valuable —
      the confidence that they could learn, create, and build with technology.

    <p>
      From writing their first lines of code to collaborating in teams and
      presenting to industry professionals, BeatCode Hackathon embodied DII’s
      mission in action.
    </p>

    <p>
      The programme also opened doors to mentorship pathways and creative
      industry exposure, reinforcing DII’s commitment to turning digital
      curiosity into long-term opportunity.

      BeatCode Hackathon 2026 was not just a competition — it was a statement of
      what is possible when young people are given access, guidance, and belief.
    </p>

    <p>
      As DII continues to expand its programmes across Nigeria, the creativity,
      confidence, and innovation displayed over these two days remain a
      powerful reminder that the future of digital Africa is already here —
      and it is coding to its own rhythm.
