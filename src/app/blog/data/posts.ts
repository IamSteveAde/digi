  <div class="article-intro">
    <p class="lede">
      On July 2nd and 3rd, the Digital Inclusion Initiative ran a two-day
      hackathon at Iman Comprehensive College in Amuwo Odofin, Lagos.
      Thirty-five SS2 students came in, learned a new skill, and used it
      to compete.
    </p>

    <p class="lede-strong">
      That is the short version. Here is the longer one.
    </p>
  </div>

  <!-- WHAT BEATCODE IS -->
  <div class="article-body">
    <h3>What BeatCode Actually Is</h3>
    <p>
      BeatCode is built around EarSketch, a platform that lets you write code
      to produce music. Students are not learning to code in the abstract. They
      are writing functions, calling variables, and layering audio samples until
      something that sounds like a real song comes out. The output is immediate
      and the learning sticks because of it.
    </p>

    <p>
      The format is intentional. DII believes that digital skills land
      differently when young people can see what they made. A coded music track
      is something you can play back, share, and be proud of. It is also proof
      that you did something technical, which matters a lot when you have never
      thought of yourself as someone who does technical things.
    </p>
  </div>

  <!-- HOW THE TWO DAYS RAN -->
  <div class="article-focus">
    <h3>How the Two Days Ran</h3>
    <p>
      Day 1 was orientation and training. Students were introduced to EarSketch,
      walked through the fundamentals of coding for music, and given time to get
      comfortable with the tools. By the end of the session, the competitive
      energy was already building.
    </p>

    <p>
      Day 2 was the hackathon itself. Students worked in thirteen groups across
      a full day of coding. Every group finished and submitted an entry. Two
      groups were selected as winners based on the quality and creativity of
      their tracks. One group took home the Best Group prize. Another was
      recognised for the most creative execution.
    </p>
  </div>

  <!-- WHAT THE SCHOOL MADE POSSIBLE -->
  <div class="article-body">
    <h3>What the School Made Possible</h3>
    <p>
      Iman Comprehensive College provided the space and the desktop computers
      that supplemented DII's device bank, giving every group access to a
      machine for the full two days. The school's administration was engaged
      throughout and expressed genuine appreciation for the programme at the
      close of the event.
    </p>
  </div>

  <!-- GRATITUDE -->
  <div class="article-focus">
    <h3>What We Are Grateful For</h3>
    <p>
      We are grateful to Iman Comprehensive College for hosting and for the
      support they brought to the table. To our facilitator and trainer, who
      kept 35 teenagers engaged across two full days of technical work. To the
      mentors and the rest of the DII team who made the sessions run. And to
      Linda Rogers, DII's Founder and Executive Director, whose commitment to
      practical digital education for young Nigerians shapes everything DII does.
    </p>
  </div>

  <!-- BIGGER PICTURE -->
  <div class="article-action">
    <h3>Why This Is Part of a Bigger Picture</h3>
    <p>
      Each of those 35 students left with a working knowledge of a coding
      environment they had never used before, a completed project, and a direct
      experience of what it feels like to build something with technology rather
      than just use it.
    </p>

    <p class="closing">
      DII's work is about making that experience available to young people who
      would not otherwise have it. BeatCode is one way we do that. It will not
      be the last.

      On May 8th, we had the opportunity to attend RUN Tech Fest 5.0 at
      Redeemer's University.
    </p>

    <p class="lede-strong">
      What stayed with us wasn't the presentation. It was the conversations.
    </p>
  </div>

  <!-- CONTEXT -->
  <div class="article-body">
    <p>
      We went to talk about our free Coursera programmes and BeatCode Hackathon
      2.0 — a few minutes on stage, then back to the booth to meet people
      one-on-one.
    </p>

    <p>
      Throughout the day, students kept stopping by to ask questions. Some wanted
      to learn data analytics. Others were interested in cybersecurity, software
      development, digital marketing, and project management. A few already knew
      exactly what they wanted to learn.
    </p>

    <p>
      The challenge wasn't a lack of interest.
    </p>

    <p>
      Many simply didn't know where to begin.
    </p>
  </div>

  <!-- WHAT WE HEARD -->
  <div class="article-focus">
    <p>
      Others had looked into online courses before but were discouraged by the
      cost. Some assumed opportunities like Coursera certificates were out of
      reach. Others weren't sure which skill to learn first or how to turn a
      skill into a career.
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      Again and again, we met people who were eager to learn and willing to
      put in the work. They weren't looking for shortcuts. They were looking
      for a starting point.
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      People often assume young Nigerians aren't interested in self-development.
      Our experience at RUN Tech Fest told a different story.
    </p>
  </div>

  <!-- THE REAL ISSUE -->
  <div class="article-body">
    <p>The appetite is there.</p>
    <p>The curiosity is there.</p>
    <p>The willingness to learn is there.</p>

    <p>
      What many people need is access. They need someone to show them that
      opportunities exist. They need affordable pathways into the digital economy.
      Sometimes they just need somebody to say, "You can start here."
    </p>
  </div>

  <!-- WHY WE EXIST -->
  <div class="article-focus">
    <p>
      Those conversations reminded us why the Digital Inclusion Initiative exists.
    </p>

    <p>
      Our work has never been just about technology. It has always been about
      people. It is about making sure that cost is not the reason someone misses
      out on learning a valuable skill. It is about helping people take that
      first step, whether through free learning opportunities, digital skills
      programmes, or community events like BeatCode Hackathon.
    </p>
  </div>

  <!-- CLOSING -->
  <div class="article-action">
    <p>
      We're grateful to the RUNTECHSPACE Community for creating a space where
      these conversations could happen. More importantly, we're grateful to every
      student who stopped by our booth, asked questions, shared their goals, and
      reminded us that there is an incredible amount of untapped potential waiting
      for an opportunity.
    </p>

    <p>
      If the conversations we had last week are anything to go by, the future is
      full of people who are ready to learn.

      Children's Day is a date on the calendar. What happened across two Lagos
      schools on May 22nd and 25th, 2026 was something more than that.
    </p>

    <p class="lede-strong">
      The Digital Inclusion Initiative joined four partner organisations for a
      two-day outreach designed to give children something concrete to take home:
      knowledge, healthcare support, and tools for learning.
    </p>
  </div>

  <!-- PARTNERS -->
  <div class="article-body">
    <p>
      The partners were The Remi Odunsi Organization, Threefold Social Impact
      Foundation, Mill Hill Ballers Club, and Eridan City. Together, the teams
      moved across two schools over two days — not to observe, but to show up
      in the fullest sense of the phrase.
    </p>
  </div>

  <!-- WHERE -->
  <div class="article-focus">
    <h3>Where We Went</h3>
    <p>
      On May 22nd, the team visited Oluwalogbon Nursery and Primary School in
      Ketu. Three days later, on May 25th, they visited Arowosegbe Nursery and
      Primary School in Alapere Ketu. Both schools served as the setting for
      what became a full day of engagement, support, and genuine community
      connection.
    </p>
  </div>

  <!-- WHAT HAPPENED -->
  <div class="article-body">
    <h3>What Happened on the Ground</h3>
    <p>
      The sessions were interactive from the start. Students participated in
      conversations about the importance of education, resilience and confidence,
      creativity and innovation, digital skills and inclusion, and personal growth
      and future aspirations.
    </p>

    <p>
      The rooms were not passive — students engaged, responded, and pushed back
      in the way children do when something actually interests them.
    </p>

    <p>
      At Arowosegbe, the outreach went further. A professional pharmacist
      accompanied the team and conducted basic health examinations for students
      on site. Where medications were needed, they were prescribed and provided.
      For many of these children, that kind of direct healthcare access is not
      a given.
    </p>

    <p>
      Every student at both schools went home with a school bag, exercise books,
      pens, and a water bottle. Small things, perhaps. But for families carrying
      the weight of school costs, they matter.
    </p>
  </div>

  <!-- WHO WAS REACHED -->
  <div class="article-focus">
    <h3>Who Was Reached</h3>
    <p>
      By the close of both days, the outreach had directly impacted 180 students
      and 35 teachers across the two schools — 215 people in total.
    </p>

    <p>
      School administrators and teachers expressed appreciation for the initiative,
      noting that collaborative efforts like this one make a measurable difference
      to learning experiences, student welfare, and community support systems.
    </p>
  </div>

  <!-- WHAT THIS MEANS -->
  <div class="article-body">
    <h3>What This Means for DII</h3>
    <p>
      Digital inclusion is not only about devices and connectivity. It begins
      with children who believe the future has something in it for them. Showing
      up in a classroom, talking about digital skills, and leaving a child with
      a bag packed for school the next morning — that is where inclusion starts.
    </p>

    <p>
      This outreach is part of DII's ongoing commitment to reaching underserved
      communities across Nigeria, not just online but in person, in classrooms,
      and in partnership with organisations that share the same vision.
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      "Children are the foundation of our nation's future. Through this
      partnership, we are not only celebrating Children's Day but actively
      investing in their growth by providing tools, knowledge, healthcare
      support, and inspiration that will create lasting impact in their lives
      and communities."

  <!-- CONTEXT -->
  <div class="article-body">
    <p>
      Digital poverty happens when people don’t have the tools, knowledge,
      or access to take part in an increasingly online world. It means you
      don’t have a working device, you can’t afford data, or no one ever
      showed you how to use these tools in the first place.
    </p>

    <p>
      This isn’t just a personal problem. It’s a social one.
    </p>

    <p>
      For some, digital poverty means being unable to join online classes
      because the household owns just one phone. For others, it means
      walking long distances to borrow a device just to fill out a
      government form or apply for a grant.
    </p>

    <p>
      Sometimes, it’s as simple and devastating as not knowing that an
      opportunity even existed, because it was shared online.
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      This is the silent exclusion that’s growing wider every year.
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      And it’s not just a rural problem. Even in cities, people are affected
      by poor network coverage, unaffordable data, or outdated devices.
      Young people with potential are locked out of opportunities.
      Women who could grow small businesses are limited by lack of access.
      Elderly people can’t get basic services or connect with their families.
    </p>
  </div>

  <!-- REALITY CHECK -->
  <div class="article-focus">
    <p>
      Many people believe digital poverty can be fixed by handing out phones
      or laptops. That’s a start — but it’s not enough.
    </p>

    <p>
      You can give someone a smartphone. But what if they don’t know how to
      send an email, use Google Maps, or fill out a digital form?
      You can set up free Wi-Fi. But what if people are afraid to use it
      because they’ve been scammed before?

      Let’s be honest: everything is going online. Government services,

    </p>

    <p>
      If you’re offline, you’re not just missing out — you’re being left

  <!-- CONTEXT -->
  <div class="article-body">
    <p>
      In many parts of the world, including Nigeria, that control is still limited.
      The gender gap shows up everywhere — in pay, land ownership, leadership,
      and representation in public office.
    </p>

    <p>
      Women are more likely to carry the burden of unpaid care work: cooking,
      cleaning, and looking after children, often without support or recognition.
    </p>

    <p>
      According to the <strong>2024 Global Gender Gap Report</strong>, full equality
      is still more than a century away. That means girls born today may grow up
      facing the same barriers their mothers and grandmothers did.

    <p>
      That’s not just unfair — it’s a waste of talent. When women are excluded,
      families, businesses, and entire economies miss out.
    </p>

    <p>
      Countries with higher gender equality consistently show stronger economies,
      healthier children, and more stable communities.
    </p>
  </div>

  <!-- DIGITAL GAP -->
  <div class="article-body">
    <p>
      One of the fastest-growing inequalities today is the <strong>digital gender gap</strong>.
      As jobs, services, and opportunities move online, women without access to
      phones, data, or basic digital skills are left behind.
    </p>

    <p>
      In Nigeria, women are far less likely than men to own smartphones or use the
      internet regularly. This limits access to jobs, business tools, financial
      services, and even critical health and safety information.

        <strong>Education and skills training</strong> — not just schooling, but
        relevant skills such as digital literacy, finance, leadership, and negotiation.

      <li>
        <strong>Fair policies and enforcement</strong> — laws must work in practice,
        not just exist on paper.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Access to tools and capital</strong> — smartphones, data,

    <p>
      On <strong>August 15, 2025</strong>, the <strong>Digital Inclusion Initiative (DII)</strong>

      a powerful panel conversation designed to spark action around equitable
      access to technology, skills, and opportunity in Africa.
    </p>

    <p>
      Held both in-person and streamed live on <strong>Instagram</strong>, the event brought

    <p>
      On <strong>August 17, 2025</strong>, the <strong>Digital Inclusion Initiative (DII)</strong>

    <p>
      The session, themed <strong>“Bridging Nigeria’s Digital Divide: Tech Solutions

  <div class="article-body">
    <p>
      On <strong>November 14, 2025</strong>, the <strong>Digital Inclusion Initiative (DII)</strong>
      hosted a powerful virtual learning session titled
      <strong>“Embracing a Growth Mindset in Your Digital Journey”</strong>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Held via <strong>Zoom</strong>, the session was led by technology leader
      <strong>Wumi Akinseye</strong> and brought together learners, professionals,
      and aspiring digital workers for a conversation that went beyond tools
      and into the psychology of digital success.
    </p>

    <p>
      Rather than focusing solely on technical skills, the discussion explored
      how mindset influences learning, confidence, and long-term career growth
      in the digital economy.
    </p>
  </div>

  <!-- WHY IT MATTERS -->
  <div class="article-focus">
    <h3>Why This Conversation Matters</h3>

    <p>
      Across Nigeria and Africa, millions of people are gaining access to digital
      tools — yet many still struggle with confidence, fear of failure, and
      imposter syndrome.
    </p>

    <p>
      At DII, digital inclusion goes beyond devices and connectivity. It also
      means helping people believe that they belong in the digital economy.
    </p>

    <p>
      This session aligned directly with DII’s mission to bridge the digital
      divide by empowering individuals not just with technology, but with the
      mindset needed to thrive.

  <!-- KEY LESSONS -->
  <div class="article-focus">
    <h3>Key Lessons from Wumi Akinseye</h3>

    <p>
      Drawing on over <strong>20 years of experience</strong> driving digital
      transformation across global industries, Wumi shared practical insights
      into how mindset shapes professional growth.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Fear of failure is often the biggest barrier to learning</strong> —
        many people avoid digital tools not because they lack ability, but
        because they fear getting it wrong.
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>Growth happens through experimentation</strong> — trying, failing,
        and trying again is how digital professionals build real expertise.
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>Resilience is a career skill</strong> — in a constantly changing
        digital landscape, adaptability is more valuable than any single tool
        or platform.
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>Confidence grows through small wins</strong> — consistent, simple
        actions build momentum and belief over time.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <!-- PRACTICAL TAKEAWAYS -->
  <div class="article-focus">
    <h3>Practical Takeaways for Learners</h3>

    <p>
      Through guided discussion and Q&amp;A, participants explored how to apply
      a growth mindset in their daily learning and work.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        Reframing mistakes as feedback rather than failure
      </li>

      <li>
        Staying curious instead of afraid when facing new technology
      </li>

      <li>
        Developing the habit of continuous learning
      </li>

      <li>
        Building emotional resilience in fast-changing work environments
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Wumi also encouraged participants to take three simple steps this month:
      try one new digital skill, reflect on what they learned, and commit to one
      improvement.

  <!-- CONTEXT -->
  <div class="article-body">
    <p>
      On <strong>Friday, November 21, 2025</strong>, the <strong>Digital Inclusion Initiative (DII)</strong>
      hosted a powerful virtual learning session titled
      <strong>“Unlocking Financial Inclusion”</strong> with fintech expert
      <strong>Francis Nwoboshi</strong> — a leading voice in digital payments and
      financial inclusion across Africa and the UK.
    </p>

    <p>
      The session brought together learners, professionals, and community
      members united by one goal: understanding how digital skills can unlock
      real financial power in everyday life.
    </p>

    <p>
      Despite having over <strong>100 million internet users</strong>, millions
      of Nigerian adults remain excluded from formal financial services —
      revealing a critical gap between access and participation.
    </p>
  </div>

  <!-- CORE INSIGHT -->
  <div class="article-focus">
    <h3>The Digital Confidence Gap</h3>

    <p>
      As Francis explained, Nigeria faces a dangerous paradox:
    </p>

    <p>
      <em>
        “Technology access alone does not guarantee financial inclusion.
        The missing link is digital confidence.”
      </em>
    </p>

    <p>
      Many Nigerians own smartphones but still hesitate to:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Use mobile banking applications</li>
      <li>Make digital payments</li>
      <li>Apply for credit or savings products</li>
      <li>Trust online financial tools</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Fear, low digital literacy, and lack of confidence keep people locked out
      of the digital economy — even when the tools are already in their hands.
    </p>
  </div>

  <!-- KEY LEARNINGS -->
  <div class="article-focus">
    <h3>Key Insights from the Session</h3>

    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong>Digital Skills Lead to Financial Power</strong><br />
        The ability to use mobile apps, payment platforms, and online services
        opens doors to banking, credit, business tools, and savings or
        investment products. Without these skills, many people remain
        economically invisible.
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>Digital Confidence Is the True Gateway</strong><br />
        The biggest barriers to financial inclusion are often psychological —
        fear of making mistakes, fear of fraud, fear of losing money, and fear
        of not understanding how systems work.
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>Simple Interventions Can Change Lives</strong><br />
        Confidence grows through guided practice, human support, and simple,
        intuitive digital experiences.
      </li>
    </ol>
  </div>

  <!-- SOLUTIONS -->
  <div class="article-focus">
    <h3>What Actually Works</h3>

    <p>
      The session explored practical solutions that have proven effective in
      helping first-time users move from fear to mastery:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Agent-assisted digital onboarding</li>
      <li>In-app tutorials with real-world practice</li>
      <li>Plain-language design and localized digital tools</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <!-- CASE STUDY -->
  <div class="article-focus">
    <h3>Real-World Proof: The OPay Case Study</h3>

    <p>
      Francis shared how <strong>OPay</strong> successfully brought millions of
      Nigerians into digital payments by focusing on:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Easy and intuitive onboarding</li>
      <li>Human support systems</li>
      <li>A simple and trusted user experience</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      The lesson was clear: confidence — not just connectivity — drives true
      financial inclusion.

      Francis also introduced a new opportunity for <strong>DII Academy</strong>
      members — a digital entrepreneurship pathway powered by
      <strong>Vendify</strong>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Through this pathway, learners can:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Sell airtime, data, electricity, and more</li>
      <li>Earn commissions directly from their smartphones</li>
      <li>Build micro-income streams within their communities</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      This is what true digital inclusion looks like — not just being connected,
      but being able to earn.
    </p>
  </div>

      Financial inclusion is not just about banking. It is about dignity,
      opportunity, and control over one’s future.
    </p>

    <p>
      Every digital skill learned, every confident tap on a screen, and every
      successful transaction brings someone closer to economic independence.
    </p>

    <p>
      At DII, we are proud to walk this journey with our community — one
      confident digital step at a time.

    <p class="lede">
      The future of work is no longer coming — it is already here.
    </p>

    <p class="lede-strong">
      As work becomes increasingly digital, the question is no longer whether
      opportunities exist, but who is prepared to seize them.
    </p>
  </div>

  <!-- CONTEXT -->
  <div class="article-body">
    <p>
      As industries across the world continue to digitise, opportunities for
      women to participate, lead, and thrive in the digital economy have never
      been greater. Yet for many women across Africa, access to skills,
      confidence, and clear digital pathways remains a challenge.
    </p>

    <p>
      On <strong>December 19, 2025</strong>, the <strong>Digital Inclusion Initiative (DII)</strong>
      hosted a powerful virtual webinar titled
      <strong>“The Future of Work Is Digital – Are Women Ready?”</strong>,
      featuring <strong>Maureen Ikeji</strong>, a respected business leader,
      strategist, and advocate for women’s leadership and growth.
    </p>

    <p>
      The session brought together women from diverse backgrounds who were eager
      to understand how technology is reshaping careers — and how they can
      position themselves for success in a rapidly evolving digital world.
    </p>
  </div>

  <!-- SPEAKER -->
  <div class="article-focus">
    <h3>Meet the Speaker</h3>

    <p>
      <strong>Maureen Ikeji</strong> is a business thought leader passionate about
      leadership growth and results, with over <strong>20 years of experience</strong>
      across IT consulting, manufacturing, supply chain, project management, and
      marketing.
    </p>

    <p>
      Prior to her current role, she served as <strong>Head of Strategy, Planning
      and Insights at British American Tobacco Nigeria</strong>, where she led a
      multidisciplinary team responsible for shaping the business agenda across
      several West African markets.
    </p>

    <p>
      Beyond her corporate career, Maureen is deeply committed to speaking,
      coaching, and mentoring young people — helping them envision and create

  </div>

  <!-- KEY THEMES -->
  <div class="article-focus">
    <h3>Rethinking Readiness for the Future of Work</h3>

    <p>
      During the session, Maureen challenged participants to rethink what it
      truly means to be “ready” for the future of work.
    </p>

    <p>
      She explained that digital readiness is not only about acquiring technical
      skills, but also about cultivating the right mindset, confidence, and
      adaptability.
    </p>

    <p>
      As automation, remote work, and digital platforms continue to transform
      how people earn a living, women who intentionally build digital capability
      and strategic career awareness are better positioned to access global
      opportunities.

      What happens when coding meets music, creativity, and youth innovation?
    </p>

    <p class="lede-strong">
      BeatCode Hackathon 2026 proved that learning technology can be inclusive,
      expressive, and deeply empowering.
    </p>
  </div>

  <!-- CONTEXT -->
  <div class="article-body">
    <p>
      The <strong>Digital Inclusion Initiative (DII)</strong>, in partnership
      with <strong>American Corner Ikeja</strong>, delivered one of its most
      ambitious and impactful youth programmes yet with the
      <strong>BeatCode Hackathon 2026</strong>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Held over two high-energy days on <strong>Thursday 8th</strong> and
      <strong>Friday 9th January</strong> at <strong>American Corner Ikeja, Lagos</strong>,
      the programme was designed for young people aged <strong>16 to 26</strong>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Rather than beginning with intimidating lines of code, participants were
      introduced to programming through music — using
      <strong>EarSketch</strong>, a powerful music-coding platform that allows
      users to create beats, melodies, and full compositions through code.
    </p>
  </div>

  <!-- EXPERIENCE -->
  <div class="article-focus">
    <h3>Learning to Code Through Creativity</h3>

    <p>
      For many participants, BeatCode Hackathon marked their first experience
      with both programming and digital music creation.
    </p>

    <p>
      Within just two days, young people who had never written code before were
      building real, functioning digital products — writing scripts that
      generated drum patterns, loops, melodies, and complete musical tracks.
    </p>

    <p>
      The hackathon reimagined how young Nigerians experience technology by
      proving that creativity can be a powerful gateway into digital skills.

  <div class="article-focus">
    <h3>Inside the Hackathon Experience</h3>

    <p>
      Over the course of the programme, <strong>30 participants</strong> were
      divided into <strong>five collaborative groups</strong>, with each
      individual required to code their own beat independently.
    </p>

    <p>
      After completing their tracks, groups listened to all submissions and
      voted to select one beat to represent them. These selected entries were
      then presented to a panel of expert judges, turning the experience into a
      real-world innovation challenge.
    </p>

    <p>
      The format blended technical learning, creativity, teamwork, and public
      presentation — key skills for success in today’s digital economy.
    </p>
  </div>

  <!-- DAY BREAKDOWN -->
  <div class="article-focus">
    <h3>Two Days of Growth and Delivery</h3>

    <p>
      <strong>Day One</strong> focused on building confidence and foundations.
      Participants were guided through EarSketch basics, coding principles, and
      creative experimentation. By the end of the day, every participant had
      already started coding an original beat.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Day Two</strong> centred on refinement, collaboration, and
      delivery. Teams finalised their tracks, selected their strongest entries,
      and prepared to pitch their work to the judges ahead of a strict midday
      submission deadline.
    </p>
  </div>

  <!-- JUDGES -->
  <div class="article-focus">
    <h3>Expert Judges, Real-World Insight</h3>

    <p>
      The hackathon was anchored by an outstanding panel of judges whose
      expertise bridged technology, media, and the creative industries.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Kenneth Akan</strong> — Technology Media and Business Growth

        evaluating entries through creativity, structure, and scalable
        thinking.
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>K9 (Noble Ugwunsinachi Eze)</strong> — Renowned Nigerian singer,
        songwriter, record producer, and audio branding creative, best known
        for his hit <em>Kokoma</em> and for creating sonic identities for major
        brands.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      K9’s presence underscored the real-world relevance of the creative and
      technical skills participants were developing.
    </p>
  </div>

  <!-- FACILITATORS -->
  <div class="article-focus">
    <h3>Guided by Passionate Facilitators</h3>

    <p>
      Training and facilitation were led by <strong>Afolabi Mogaji</strong>, an
      emerging educator and tech facilitator known for his clarity, patience,
      and hands-on teaching approach.
    </p>

    <p>
      Supporting the creative side of the programme was
      <strong>Akinsanya Oluwasegun</strong>, a professional DJ and creative
      trainer who helped participants translate rhythm, structure, and sound
      design into code.
    </p>
  </div>

  <!-- RESULTS -->
  <div class="article-focus">
    <h3>Celebrating Excellence</h3>

    <p>
      As final presentations concluded and judges deliberated, what began as
      curiosity had evolved into polished, coded musical creations.
    </p>

    <p>
      At the awards ceremony, two standout winners emerged:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>The Jazz Group</strong> — Best Group Beat</li>
      <li><strong>Kennior</strong> — Best Individual Beat</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Both winners demonstrated how quickly young people can move from learning
      to excellence when given the right tools and support.
    </p>
  </div>

  <!-- IMPACT -->
  <div class="article-focus">
    <h3>Beyond the Competition</h3>

    <p>
      Beyond prizes, every participant left with something far more valuable —
      the confidence that they could learn, create, and build with technology.
    </p>

    <p>
      From writing their first lines of code to collaborating in teams and
      presenting to industry professionals, BeatCode Hackathon embodied DII’s
      mission in action.
    </p>

    <p>
      The programme also opened doors to mentorship pathways and creative
      industry exposure, reinforcing DII’s commitment to turning digital
      curiosity into long-term opportunity.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="article-action">
    <p class="closing">
      BeatCode Hackathon 2026 was not just a competition — it was a statement of
      what is possible when young people are given access, guidance, and belief.

    <p>
      As DII continues to expand its programmes across Nigeria, the creativity,
      confidence, and innovation displayed over these two days remain a
      powerful reminder that the future of digital Africa is already here —
      and it is coding to its own rhythm.
